# Comment Lines
* We can write notes in our code. If we mark them correctly, Python will ignore them.
* There is 2 different ways to mark our comments.
```
#This is a comment
print("Hello world!") # This is another comment.
```
or
```
"""
Also we can mark paragraphs with these marks.
Python will ignore everything between these.
"""
print("Hello world!")
```
* Try it yourself.
```
#We can mark the paragraphs with this operator as well.
#print("Hello world!")
#Python will ignore everything in here. Even if it is executable.
print("Hello world!")
```
* Only one "Hello world!" will be printed.
