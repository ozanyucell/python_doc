# Lists
 * Lists are used to store multiple data in a single variable. This is similar to arrays that exist in many other programming languages.
 * We are creating lists with square brackets:

```
list_name = ["variable_0", "variable_1", "variable_2", "variable_3"]
```

* List's data are indexed by starting from 0. So,
```
variable_0 => 0. index
variable_1 => 1. index
variable_2 => 2. index
variable_3 => 3. index
```

* Python also supporting negative indexing,
```
variable_0 =>  0. index
variable_1 => -3. index
variable_2 => -2. index
variable_3 => -1. index
```
